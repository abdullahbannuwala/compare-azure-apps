# Q: What authentication method are you using to access Azure App Configuration?
In the code examples provided, I've used the Azure Managed Identity for authentication to access Azure App Configuration. This is achieved by using the DefaultAzureCredential class, 
which automatically selects the appropriate authentication method based on the environment 
in which the code is running. It can utilize environment variables, managed identity, or other means of authentication, making it a secure and versatile choice for accessing Azure services.

# Q: Are the environments set as individual configurations in Azure or do you have a unique way of managing each one?
In the code examples provided, the environments are managed as individual configurations in Azure App Configuration. Each environment (e.g., development and production) is accessed through a separate Azure App
Configuration resource with its own endpoint URL. The code fetches configuration settings from each environment by specifying the environment label when retrieving the settings.
This approach assumes that you have separate Azure App Configuration resources for each environment, which is a common practice for managing configurations in a multi-environment setup,
such as development, testing, staging, and production. Each resource can contain configuration settings specific to its environment, and the code distinguishes between them based on their labels.

# Q: Do the keys follow a certain naming pattern that corresponds to each environment?
In the code examples provided, the keys do not necessarily follow a specific naming pattern to correspond to each environment. Instead, 
the code associates keys with their respective environments based on the label assigned to each configuration setting in Azure App Configuration.

# Q: Do you already have authorization set up to access each of the Azure App Configuration stores or will this need to be part of the development?
In the provided code examples, authorization to access Azure App Configuration is set up using Azure Managed Identity. This means that the code relies on the identity of the application
or service it is running within to obtain the necessary
permissions to access the Azure App Configuration stores.
